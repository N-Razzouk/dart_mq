/// An abstract base class representing a message queue client.
///
/// The `BaseMQClient` abstract base class defines the core functionality and
/// contract for implementing message queue clients. It serves as a foundation
/// for creating client implementations that interact with message queues for
/// sending and receiving messages.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyMQClient extends BaseMQClient {
///   // Custom implementation of the message queue client.
/// }
/// ```
abstract base class BaseMQClient {}
